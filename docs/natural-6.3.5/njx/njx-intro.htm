      <p>Using Natural for Ajax, you can create rich internet applications which
              use the Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) technology. This enables Natural
              users on Windows, UNIX and mainframe platforms to develop and use Natural
              applications with a browser-based user interface, similar to GUI desktop
              applications.

              <a name="x3"></a>What is a Rich Internet Application?
      </h2> 
           
           
      <p>Classical HTML- and browser-based applications suffer from known
               disadvantages. The server responds to each user interaction with a new page.
               This may lead to long response times and new rendering in the browser and thus
               to a discontinuous workflow for the user. The possibilities offered by DHTML
               overcome these disadvantages, but they are complicated to use and make it hard
               to build a comfortable user interface. The user interface is therefore often
               simpler and less comfortable than users are accustomed to from their experience
               with desktop applications. Although it is possible to provide complex controls
               and features like drag-and-drop, this is hard to implement - especially if
               compatibility with all commonly used browsers is required. Classical GUI
               applications also have the disadvantage that a client component of the
               application must be installed on each client machine. 
      </p> 
           
      <p>Rich internet applications that use the Ajax technology overcome these
               disadvantages by combining the reachability of browser-based applications with
               the rich user interface of GUI applications. Software AG provides support for
               the development of rich internet applications with Application Designer. Natural for Ajax
               combines the user interface capabilities of Application Designer with the application
               development capabilities of Natural.

      <h2>Rich Internet Applications with Natural</h2> 
           
           
      <p>At runtime, a rich internet application with Natural has the following
               structure:
      </p> 
            
           
           
      <ul> 
               
         <li> 
                   
            <p class="initem">A Natural host session on a Windows, UNIX or mainframe server runs
                       the application code. Other than with a map application, the application does
                       not deal with user interface issues. It contains only the application logic and
                       communicates with the user interface layer by sending and receiving data. The
                       data is displayed in page in a web browser. Events - such as button clicks -
                       that the user raises in the web browser are passed back to the application
                       code. Along with an event, the application code receives also the data that the
                       user modified in the web browser. It processes the event and the data and
                       returns modified data back to the web browser page.
            </p> 
                   
                  
         </li> 
               
         <li> 
                   
            <p class="initem">Natural for Ajax, which is running on an application server, merges
                       the data received from the Natural application into a DHTML page and delivers
                       the page to the web browser. In the inverse direction, Natural for Ajax
                       forwards events that the user raised in the web browser along with the modified
                       data to the Natural application.
            </p>

         <li> 
                   
            <p class="initem">A web browser renders the DHTML page. JavaScript code on the page
                       processes local user interaction and exchanges data with Natural for Ajax as
                       needed. It uses Ajax technology to exchange data with the Natural application
                       in the background without having to re-render the page as a whole.
            </p> 
                  
         </li> 
              
      </ul> 
           
      <p>At development time, a rich internet application is created with
               Natural in the following way:
      </p> 
           
      <ul> 
               
         <li> 
                   
            <p class="initem">Application Designer is used to develop the user interface layout of a web page and
                       to bind the controls on the page to data elements in the application. Application Designer is
                       contained in the Natural for Ajax module running on the application server.
                       
            </p>

            <p class="initem">When the user saves the page layout, a Natural module of type
                       "Adapter" is generated. The adapter serves as an interface between

               <li class="nesteditem"> 
                           
                  <p class="initem">A code skeleton, in the form of comment lines, that contains
                               handlers for the expected events. The application programmer can copy this code
                               skeleton into the main program to implement the event handlers.
                  </p>

         <li> 
                   
            <p class="initem">Then a main program is implemented that exchanges data with the web
                       page using the adapter and handles the events. The event handler code has no
                       knowledge of the web page layout, but operates only on the page data that is
                       sent and received through the adapter.

            <p class="initem">The navigation between different pages is implemented. A rich
                       internet application navigates between pages in the same way as a map

      <h2>Mixed Applications</h2> 
           
           
      <p>With the support of Unicode, Natural has introduced the Natural Web I/O
               Interface which renders Natural maps in a web browser. Typically, if you are
               running map-oriented applications and wish to change them to rich internet
               applications, you will do this gradually. In certain parts of an application,
               maps might be replaced by rich GUI pages, other parts will possibly be left
               unchanged. Therefore, Natural supports running mixed applications which consist
               of both maps and rich GUI pages. With maps, the application controls the page
               layout, and the rendering mechanism therefore respects the layout information
               that the application provides. With rich GUI pages, the application does not
               control the layout; the layout is controlled by Application Designer. However, for the users
               of an application the switch between maps and rich GUI pages is seamless.
