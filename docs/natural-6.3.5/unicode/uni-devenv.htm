      <h2>Development Environment</h2> 
          
          
      <p>The development environment for Unicode applications is Natural Single
              Point of Development (SPoD).
      </p> 
          
      <p><img src="graphics/uni-dev-env.png" alt="Development environment" width="500" height="500"></p> 
          
      <p>In a SPoD environment, the Natural objects of a Unicode application
              which are located on a Natural Development Server (NDV) can be modified using
              Natural Studio. If supported by the server, the sources are exchanged between
              client and server in UTF-8 format. 
      </p> 
          
      <p>On NDV servers for UNIX and OpenVMS, the setting of the profile
              parameter <a href="../parms/sutf8.htm"><code>SUTF8</code></a> determines the format
              that is used when storing the Natural object on the server. This is handled
              just like the local Windows case.
      </p> 
          
      <p>On NDV servers for mainframes, the objects are stored with the default
              or their original encoding, depending on the setting of the profile parameter
              <a href="../parms/sretain.htm"><code>SRETAIN</code></a>.

      <h2>Customizing Your Environment</h2> 
          
          
          
      <p>On Windows, UNIX and OpenVMS platforms, it is important that you define
              the correct default code page for your environment before changing any Natural
              code. For more information, see <a href="uni-migrate.htm#uni-migrate">Migrating Existing
            Applications</a>.
      </p> 
          
      <p>If you want to store characters from different languages in your
              sources, you have to save the sources in UTF-8 format on Windows, UNIX or
              OpenVMS platforms, or you have to use hexadecimal UH constants in the sources.
              With the profile parameters <a href="../parms/sutf8.htm"><code>SUTF8</code></a> and
              <a href="../parms/sretain.htm"><code>SRETAIN</code></a> you can control in
              which format sources are saved. The following table lists some situations and
              the recommended settings.
      </p> 
          
      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong><br>On UNIX and OpenVMS, the parameter <code>SUTF8</code> can
              only be used in a SPoD environment.

      </table> 
           
          
      <p>If the parameter <code>SUTF8</code> is set to
              "OFF" and you stow a source which contains
              characters from different character sets, but which was not yet saved in UTF-8
              format, it is possible that the generated program is created, but that the
              source cannot be saved and thus remains unchanged. This happens if characters
              from different character sets are used in a comment or in a U constant. For
              this reason, it is recommended that you set the parameter
              <code>SUTF8</code> to "ON" if you want to
              create sources with characters from different character sets and if your
              sources do not need to be distributed to mainframe platforms.
      </p> 
          
      <p>If the parameter <code>SRETAIN</code> is set to
              "OFF", all sources are saved with the default code
              page. You have to be careful with this setting because it may lead to improper
              code page information if you have sources which were created with an earlier
              Natural version. In this case, the encoding information of the source is
              unassigned and the source is always opened with the default code page (value of
              the system variable <a href="../vari/sysenv.htm#CODEPAGE"><code>*CODEPAGE</code></a>).
              This will often work even if the default code page is not the correct encoding
              of the source. Some language-specific characters will be displayed incorrectly
              in this case. If such a source is opened with the wrong code page and is saved
              with <code>SRETAIN</code> being set to
              "ON", no encoding will be stored for the source; the
              source can later be opened correctly if Natural is started with the correct
              default code page. However, once you have saved the source with
              <code>SRETAIN</code> being set to "OFF",
              the default code page will be saved as the encoding of the source; from this
              time on, the source will only be opened with this code page. For this reason,
              you should use this setting only if you are certain that all of your Natural
              sources are encoded in the default code page.

      <h2>Editors</h2> 
          
          
      <p>The Natural for Windows editors are fully Unicode-enabled. Via SPoD they
              can also be used for mainframe, UNIX and OpenVMS sources. The editors provided
              with Natural for Mainframes, Natural for UNIX and Natural for OpenVMS are not
              Unicode-enabled.
      </p> 
           
          
      <p>When a source is opened with an editor in Natural Studio (Natural for
              Windows), the content of the source will be converted from the corresponding
              code page to Unicode before it is loaded into the editor. This will guarantee
              that all characters can be displayed correctly even if the source contains
              characters which are not included in the system code page. If the conversion
              from the source's code page to Unicode fails, an error will be displayed and
              the editor is not opened. In this case, the user has to define the correct
              encoding of the source. The source encoding can be changed in the
              <span class="selectable_label">Properties</span> dialog box (see
              <cite>Properties for the Nodes</cite> in the
              <cite>Using Natural Studio</cite> documentation).
      </p> 
          
      <p>For Windows, UNIX and OpenVMS sources, the Natural for Windows editors
              allow saving sources which contain characters from different languages in UTF-8
              format. On mainframes, it will not be possible to save UTF-8 sources. 
      </p> 
          
      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong><br>If you save a UNIX or OpenVMS source in UTF-8 format or with a code
              page which differs from the default code page, the source can no longer be
              opened with the native Natural for UNIX or Natural for OpenVMS editor.
              Mainframe sources can be saved with a different code page and can be edited
              with the native Natural for Mainframes editors. 
      </p> 
          
      <p>Even if you do not want to use Unicode strings in your programs and
              sources, the Unicode-enabled editors have the advantage that you can write
              sources in all code pages, no matter which system code page is installed. For
              example, if you have installed the "windows-1252"
              (Latin 1) code page, you can write a program containing Cyrillic characters and
              save this program with the "windows-1251" (Cyrillic)
              code page. You only have to select code page
              "windows-1251" in the <span class="selectable_label">Save As</span>
              dialog box (see <cite>Saving an Object with a New Name</cite> in the
              <cite>Using Natural Studio</cite> documentation).
      </p> 
          
      <p>Using the Natural for Windows program editor, you can convert text
              constants into their hexadecimal Unicode representations (see
              <cite>Converting to Hexadecimal Format</cite> in the
              <cite>Program Editor</cite> section of the Natural for Windows
              <cite>Editors</cite> documentation). If you are developing for a
              platform where UTF-8 sources are not preferred, you can thus enter all
              characters for a Unicode constant, select all the characters of the constant,
              convert them to their hexadecimal representation and then add the
              "UH" prefix for Unicode hexadecimal constants.
              Furthermore, when you hover the mouse pointer over a character or a selected
              character range of a text constant, a tool tip shows the corresponding
              hexadecimal Unicode representation.
      </p> 
          
      <p>A byte order mark (BOM) consists of the character code
              "U+FEFF" at the beginning of a data stream where it
              can be used as a signature defining the byte order and encoding form, primarily
              of unmarked plain-text files. On Windows, a byte order mark is used by some
              editors (for example, Notepad) to mark UTF-8 files. The Natural for Windows
              editors will recognize an UTF-8 byte order mark when reading an object. If the
              object has no other encoding defined so far, Natural will interpret it as UTF-8
              and when the object is saved, UTF-8 will be stored as the encoding for the
              object. The byte order mark is removed in this case.
