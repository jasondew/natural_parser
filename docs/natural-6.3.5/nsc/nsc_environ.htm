      <h2> Concept of Environment Protection</h2> 
          
          
      <p>Natural Security allows you to make users' access to a library
              environment-specific. A Natural <em>environment</em> is determined by the
              combination of the system files FNAT, FUSER, FSEC and FDIC. You define a
              security profile for each environment (that is, for each system-file
              combination) you wish to protect, and control users' access to it. You can also
              make a library accessible in some environments, but not in others.
      </p> 
          
      <p>A logon to another environment occurs when a users logs onto a library
              located on another FUSER system file (as specified by the
              <a href="nsc_lib.htm#Library_File">"Library File"</a>
              DBID/FNR in the library profile).
      </p> 
          
      <p>Whenever a user logs on to a library in another environment, Natural
              Security will check whether:
      </p> 
          
      <ul> 
              
         <li> 
                  
            <p class="initem">access to the library is allowed in that environment, and</p> 
                 
         </li> 
              
         <li> 
                  
            <p class="initem">the user is authorized to access that environment.</p> 
                 
         </li> 
             
      </ul> 
          
      <p>Such a check is performed not only when a user explicitly logs on to a
              library, but also when the user invokes a function which implicitly accesses
              another library or processes the contents of another library.
      </p>

      <h2> Activation of Environment Protection</h2> 
          
          
      <p>Environment protection is activated by setting the general option

                 Protection"</a> to "Y".
      </p> 
          
      <p>If environment protection is active, the following applies:</p>

            <p class="initem">For every environment to be accessed, an environment security profile
                      has to be defined.

                  <p>You can specify a one-character alias for the environment profile.
                     An alias can be shared by multiple environment profiles. By specifying the same
                     alias in several environment profiles, you can form groups of environments.

                  <p>For example, you can use aliases like: D - for all development
                               environments, T - for all test environments, P - for all production
                               environments.

                  <p>This will make the maintenance of environment profiles easier,
                               because you can use the alias as selection criterion on the Environment
                               Maintenance selection list to list all profiles which have the same alias.

                  <p>For Natural SAF Security the following applies: The alias is used
                               in the external security system to define the resources related to the
                               system-file combination of this environment. The rules defined for an alias in
                               the external security system apply to all system-file combinations in whose
                               environment profiles this alias is specified.

      <h2> Disallowing/Allowing Access to Libraries in Environments</h2> 
          
          
      <p>By default, when environment protection is active, access to a library
              is allowed in any environment. For individual environments, you can disallow
              access to a library.
      </p> 
          
      <p>When access to a library is disallowed in at least one environment, the
              fact that the library is "environment-protected" will be indicated
              in the library's security profile.
      </p> 
          
      <p>Two functions are available to disallow/allow environment-specific
              access to libraries:

      <ul>

               addition, you can select the option "Select only disallowed ones"
               - in which case the list of libraries to be displayed will only include those
               libraries for which access in the environment is currently disallowed.
      </p> 
           
      <p>Then, the Disallow/Allow Libraries screen will be displayed, showing

      <p>By default, when environment protection is active, access to an
              environment is allowed for all users. For individual users you can disallow
              access to an environment.
      </p> 
          
      <p>Access to an environment can only be allowed/disallowed for users of
              types GROUP, ADMINISTRATOR and PERSON. For users of types ADMINISTRATOR and
              PERSON it can be allowed/disallowed either directly or via a GROUP. For users
              of types MEMBER and TERMINAL, it can only be allowed/disallowed for the GROUP
              to which they are assigned.
      </p> 
          
      <p>When access to at least one environment is disallowed for a user, the
              session option <a href="nsc_user.htm#SessionOptions">"Environment
                 Protection"</a> in the user's security profile is automatically
              to "Y".
      </p> 
          
      <p>Two functions are available to disallow/allow users' access to
              environments:
      </p> 
          
      <ul> 
              
         <li> 
                  
            <p class="initem">To disallow/allow access of various users to one environment, you use
                      the function <a href="nsc_environ.htm#LinkUsersEnv">"Protect
                         environment"</a> (which is invoked from the Environment
                      Maintenance selection list).
            </p> 
                 
         </li> 
              
         <li> 
                  
            <p class="initem">To disallow/allow access of one user to various environments, you use
                      the function <a href="nsc_environ.htm#LinkUserEnvs">"Protect
                         environments"</a> (which is invoked from the User Maintenance
                      selection list).
            </p> 
                 
         </li> 
             
      </ul> 
          
      <p>Both functions are described below.</p> 
          
         
      <div><a name="LinkUsersEnv"></a></div> 
          
      <h3> Protecting a Single Environment for Multiple Users</h3> 
           
           
      <p>On the Environment Maintenance selection list, you mark the environment
               you wish to protect with "EP".
      </p> 
           
      <p>A window will be displayed. Here you enter a "U" in the
               field "Protect for users/libraries". You can also enter a Start
               Value (as described in the section <a href="nsc_way.htm#nsc_way">Finding Your Way in Natural
            Security</a>) for the list of users to be displayed. In
               addition, you can select the option "Select only disallowed ones"
               - in which case the list of users to be displayed will only include those users
               for whom access to the environment is currently disallowed.
      </p> 
           
      <p>Then, the Disallow/Allow Users screen will be displayed, showing the
               list of users. By default, the list contains only users of type GROUP. To
               switch between a list of GROUPs and a list of all three user types, you press
               <span class="key">PF5</span>. The list can be scrolled as described in the section
               <a href="nsc_way.htm#nsc_way">Finding Your Way In Natural
            Security</a>.
      </p> 
           
      <p>On the list, you mark the users for whom you wish to disallow/allow
               access to the environment.
      </p> 
           
      <p>In the "Co" column, you may mark each user with one of the
               following function codes:

      <p>You can mark one or more users on the screen with a function code. For
               each user marked, the selected functions will then be executed one after
               another. When processing is completed, a message will indicate the access
               situation now in effect for each user.

      <h3> Protecting Multiple Environments for a Single User</h3> 
           
           
      <p>On the User Maintenance selection list, you mark the user for whom you
               wish to protect environments with function code "EP".
      </p> 
           
      <p>A window will be displayed. Here you can enter a Start Value (as
               described in the section <a href="nsc_way.htm#nsc_way">Finding Your Way
            in Natural Security</a>) for the list of environments to be
               displayed; as start value, you use the database ID / file number of the
               environments' FNAT system file. You can also select the option "Select
               only disallowed environments" - in which case the list of environments
               to be displayed will only include those environments to which access is
               currently disallowed for the user.
      </p> 
           
      <p>Then, the Disallow/Allow Environments screen will be displayed, showing
               the list of environments. For each environment, either its system-file
               combination (database IDs and file numbers of system files FUSER, FDIC, FSEC
               and FNAT) or its ID is displayed; with <span class="key">PF4</span> you can switch between
               the two displays. It addition, each environment profile's alias (AL) and
               protection status (P) are displayed. The list can be scrolled as described in
               the section <a href="nsc_way.htm#nsc_way">Finding Your Way In Natural

               disallow/allow for the user.
      </p> 
           
      <p>In the "Co" column, you may mark each environment with one
