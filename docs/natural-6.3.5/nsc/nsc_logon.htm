              file specified in the parameter file/module used is a non-Security system file,
              Natural cannot be started, and the user will receive an appropriate error

      </p>

      <p>When Natural Security is installed, the Natural Security logon screen
               will be displayed whenever a user invokes Natural.
      </p> 
           
      <p>Under Windows, the logon screen is displayed as a dialog box (for the
               sake of consistency, however, it will also be referred to as "logon
               screen").
      </p> 
           
      <p>The logon screen requests the user to enter the following:</p>

                     list contains all non-protected libraries and all protected libraries to which
                     the user is linked (either directly, or via a group whose security profile is
                     activated). The list also contains all libraries available to the user's
                     terminal (if the terminal is defined to Natural Security. To view a list of all
                     libraries available to the terminal, the user may enter an asterisk (*) in the

      <h4> Passwords</h4> 
            
            
      <p>In a user's security profile, the Natural Security administrator may
                change the password, and may also set a time interval, after which the user
                will be forced to change the password. The user will then have to enter a
                password and a new password to be able to log on (for details on these options,
                see the section <a href="nsc_user.htm#nsc_user">User
            Maintenance</a>).
      </p> 
            
      <p>If a user has forgotten his or her password, he/she will have to
                contact the Natural Security administrator, who may then specify a new password
                in the user's security profile. This will then be the valid password for the
                user (which he/she may change again in the logon screen).
      </p> 
            
      <p>A password or new password when entered will not be displayed on the
                screen.

      <h4> Logon Customization</h4> 
            
            
      <p>You can customize the logon screen / logon dialog box to suit your
                requirements:
      </p> 
            
      <ul> 
                
         <li> 
                     
                    
            <p class="initem"><strong>Mainframe computers, UNIX and OpenVMS:</strong><br> The source code of the logon screen, map NOGONM1, is provided in
                        the library SYSSEC. To customize the logon screen, you make a copy of NOGONM1,
                        store it under the name LOGONM1, modify it to suit your requirements, catalog
                        it, and then copy the cataloged object LOGONM1 into the library SYSLIB. Should
                        LOGONM1 be missing from SYSLIB, the Natural Security installation procedure
                        will automatically copy the object module NOGONM1 from SYSSEC to SYSLIB and
                        store it there under the name LOGONM1; this ensures that a default logon screen
                        is always present if no customized one is used.

            <p class="initem"><strong>Windows:</strong><br> The same applies as described above for the logon screen - except
                        that the names for logon dialog box are different: The source provided in the
                        library SYSSEC is called GNOGONM1, and the object to be copied into the library
                        SYSLIB is called GLOGONM1.

      <p>If the first logon to a library at the beginning of a Natural session
              was successful, a user may change from one library to another by using the
              Natural system command LOGON.
      </p> 
          
      <p>See also the Natural <cite>System Commands</cite> documentation
              for information on the LOGON system command.
      </p> 
          
      <p>The LOGON command takes the following parameters:</p> 
          
      <ul> 
              
         <li>

                      specified, the Natural Security logon screen will be invoked. For example:
            </p>

                 </li> 
              
         <li> 
                  
            <p class="initem">If one parameter is specified, it will be interpreted as a library ID.
                      For example:
            </p> 
                  <pre class="verbatim">LOGON LIBX</pre>

                  <pre class="verbatim">LOGON USERX PASSWX</pre>

      <h3> LOGON Command Errors</h3> 
           
           
      <p>If an error is detected during logon processing, Natural Security will
               display an error message.
      </p> 
           
      <p>If the LOGON command has been invoked from a library, Natural Security
               will invoke the error transaction defined for the library. If no error
               transaction is defined, the logon screen will be invoked.
      </p>

             <a name="x7"></a> 
             <a name="x8"></a>Automatic Logon
      </h2> 
          
          
      <p>Users would normally have to log on twice, first to the operating system
              and second to Natural. To eliminate the need for a second logon, you may set
              the Natural profile parameter <a href="../parms/auto.htm">AUTO</a>
              to AUTO=ON (which is described in the Natural <cite>Parameter
                 Reference</cite> documentation).
      </p> 
          
      <p>As a result, an internal Natural Security logon procedure will be
              invoked, which uses the operating-system login name (as contained in the
              Natural system variable *INIT-USER) as the user ID, but no password (on the
              assumption that this has been verified by the operating-system logon
              procedure). The Natural Security logon screen will be suppressed. A logon with
              a user ID other than the operating-system login name will not be possible.
      </p> 
          
      <p>If AUTO=ON is used, the user has no possibility of specifying a library
              ID. The library to which the user will be logged on is determined by the same
              rules as described under <a href="nsc_logon.htm#Logon_Without_Library_ID">Logon Without Library
            ID</a> above. This means that automatic logon is only possible
              if a default library is specified (for the user or one of his/her Privileged
              Groups) or the user has a private library.
      </p> 
          
      <p>If you combine AUTO=ON with specifying a default library in a user's
              security profile and with specifying a startup transaction for that library,
              the user will receive the first screen of the default library immediately after
              invoking Natural without having to pass any intermediate screens (default
              libraries are described under <a href="nsc_user.htm#Components_of_a_User_Profile">Components of a User
            Profile</a> in the section <cite>User
                 Maintenance</cite>, startup transactions under
              <a href="nsc_lib.htm#Transactions">Transactions</a> in
              the section <cite>Library Maintenance</cite>).
      </p> 
          
      <p>If AUTO=ON is set, the system command LOGOFF has the same result as the
              system command FIN (see <a href="nsc_logon.htm#How_to_End_a_Natural_Session">How to End a Natural
            Session</a> below).
      </p> 
          
      <p>If AUTO=ON is set, and after the initial automatic logon the user tries
              to log on to another library and causes a logon error, the error transaction
              for the current library will be invoked. If no error transaction is specified,
              an error message will be issued and then the startup transaction (if specified)
              for the current library will be invoked.
