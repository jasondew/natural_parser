      <h2> Using Owners</h2> 
          
          
      <p>The benefit of using <em>owners</em> for security profiles is that the
              work and responsibility of doing Natural Security maintenance may be
              distributed amongst several ADMINISTRATORs instead of resting in the hands of
              just one person.
      </p> 
          
      <p>This distribution may be done according to criteria of
              significance/sensitivity of objects, regional, branch or departmental aspects,
              or whatever suits your specific Natural environment.
      </p> 
          
      <p>The number of ADMINISTRATORs should be kept low, and the system by which
              you assign owners should be clearly structured.
      </p> 
          
      <p>It is also possible to enter a GROUP as an owner. All ADMINISTRATORs
              contained in the GROUP will then be authorized to maintain the security
              profile. (As only ADMINISTRATORs may do Natural Security maintenance anyhow,
              users of other user types contained in that GROUP will not be affected by
              this.)
      </p> 
          
        
        
      <div class="noprint">
         <p><a href="nsc_count.htm#Top"><img src="../graphics/uparrow.png" alt="Top of page" height="17" width="17" border="0"></a></p>
      </div>
      <div><a name="Using_Countersignatures"></a></div> 
         
      <h2> Using Countersignatures</h2> 
          
          
      <p>It is the Natural Security ADMINISTRATORs who control all users' access
              rights to libraries. The question may well be asked, "Who controls the
              ADMINISTRATORs?" The answer is that they can control each other. This
              may be achieved by the use of <em>countersignatures</em>.
      </p> 
          
      <p>A security profile may have up to 8 owners. Without countersignatures,
              each of these owners may modify, delete, link, or edit the security profile
              unhindered.
      </p> 
          
      <p>If this is not desired, the countersignatures feature may be used: next
              to each owner of a security profile you may enter a number (1, 2 or 3); an
              owner must then obtain this number of countersignatures from other owners of
              the security profile, before he/she can gain access to the security profile. In
              this way, an owner cannot execute any alterations without the knowledge and
              consent of other owners.
      </p> 
          
      <p>Countersignatures are given by the co-owners entering their user
              <em>passwords</em> on the Countersignatures screen; this screen is displayed
              automatically when a function is invoked that requires countersignatures from
              co-owners of the security profile concerned.
      </p> 
          
      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong><br> If the <a href="nsc_admin.htm#Lock_User_Option">Lock User
                 Option</a> is active, entering a wrong password on the Countersignatures
              screen may result in the user who has invoked the screen being locked.

      <h2> Groups as Co-Owners</h2> 
          
          
      <p>If a GROUP appears as a co-owner on the Countersignatures screen, any
              one of the ADMINISTRATORs contained in the GROUP may countersign.
      </p> 
          
      <p>To select one ADMINISTRATOR from a GROUP, enter a "?" in
              the User ID field next to the Group ID on the Countersignatures screen. A list
              of all ADMINISTRATORs contained in the GROUP will be displayed, from which you
              may select the one whose countersignature you wish to obtain.
      </p> 
          
      <p>Please note that a GROUP counts as one co-owner, and one co-owner cannot
              provide more than one countersignature. If, for example, two countersignatures
              are required, these may not both be obtained from members of the same
              GROUP.
      </p> 
          
      <p>However, one ADMINISTRATOR may countersign more than once if he/she
              appears more than once as a co-owner on the Countersignatures screen, i.e. in
              his/her own right and/or as a member of one or more GROUPs.
      </p>

      <h2> User Security Profiles of ADMINISTRATORs</h2> 
          
          
      <p>When an ADMINISTRATOR wishes to create any new security profiles (that
              is, to use an Add or Copy function), the owner situation of his/her own
              security profile applies:
      </p> 
          
      <ul> 
              
         <li> 
                  
            <p class="initem">If the ADMINISTRATOR's security profile has no owners assigned, he/she
                      may create new security profiles unhindered.
            </p> 
                 
         </li> 
              
         <li> 
                  
            <p class="initem">If the ADMINISTRATOR's security profile has owners assigned but these
                      do not include the ADMINISTRATOR, he/she must obtain the countersignatures of
                      all owners of his/her security profile, before he/she may create any new
                      security profiles.
            </p>

         <li> 
                  
            <p class="initem">If the ADMINISTRATOR is one of the owners of his/her own security
                      profile and has a number of co-owners specified, the ADMINISTRATOR must obtain
                      this number of countersignatures from other owners of his/her security profile,
                      before he/she may create any new security profiles.

      <p>If a security profile has become completely inaccessible - that is, if
              an owner/co-owner configuration has been set up which does not allow any
              ADMINISTRATOR to access the security profile - the Natural system command INPL
              can be used as a last resort to recover the security profile.
      </p> 
          
      <p>You enter the INPL command; then, on the INPL menu, you enter Code
              "R" and Replace option "O". In the next window, you
              enter the object type and the ID of the security profile to be recovered. This
              deletes all owner entries from the security profile.
      </p> 
          
      <p>If you use the above INPL option in batch mode, work file 1 must be the
              Natural Security INPL file.
