      <h2> Before You Begin</h2> 
          
          
      <p>Before you begin to define users to Natural Security, it is recommended
              that you take a few preparatory steps:
      </p> 
          
      <ul> 
              
         <li> 
                  
            <p class="initem">Make a list of all people in your organization who are using
                      Natural.
            </p> 
                 
         </li> 
              
         <li> 
                  
            <p class="initem">Divide them into groups according to the work they do and in view of
                      the Natural libraries they are to use. The division of your company into
                      departments may be a guideline. People using the same libraries should be in
                      the same groups. (People may be in more than one group.)
            </p> 
                 
         </li> 
             
      </ul> 
          
      <p>It is recommended that groups be used as much as possible, as this will
              not only reduce Natural Security maintenance considerably, but also provides
              for a more consistent protection setup.
      </p> 
          
      <p>The definition of users to Natural Security and the assignment of users
              to groups is best done in the following order:
      </p> 
          
      <ol> 
              
         <li> 
                  
            <p class="initem">Create a group security profile; that is, define a user of type
                      GROUP.
            </p> 
                 
         </li> 
              
         <li> 
                  
            <p class="initem">Create individual user security profiles; that is, define users
                      (typically of type MEMBER).
            </p> 
                 
         </li> 
              
         <li> 
                  
            <p class="initem">Assign MEMBERs to the GROUP; that is, modify the GROUP security
                      profile.
            </p>

                           libraries, that is, their use can be controlled in the same way as that of
                                        "normal" libraries. The only difference is that if a private

                        <p class="initem"><strong>Private mode:</strong><br> In this mode, a private library can only be accessed by the
                                        user who is directly attached to it, that is, whose user ID is the same as the
                                        library ID. Not even a Natural Security administrator has access to it. (The
                                        only way for an administrator to gain access to a private library is by
                                        modifying the user's password in the user's security profile and then logging
                                        on to the private library with the user's user ID and the new password.) Thus,
                                        such a private library provides a certain degree of seclusion for the user; and
                                        possible misuse of this seclusion is hard to eliminate. Therefore it is
                                        recommended that this mode <var>not</var> be used.

                should be "M" (except individuals who are Natural Security
                administrators and have to be user type "A").

      <p>Once an individual has been defined, you can later change his/her user
                type classification (as explained under

      <h4> Default Profile</h4> 
            
            
      <p>When you add a new user, you can either type in every item within the
                user security profile by hand; or you can use a pre-defined user default
                profile as a template for the security profile you are creating.
      </p> 
            
      <p>Before you use default profiles, you should be familiar with the
                "normal" way of defining users (that is, without default profile).
      </p> 
            
      <p>Default profiles are created and maintained in the Administrator
                Services subsystem.
      </p> 
            
      <p>The <var>user type</var> of the default profile you
                specify must be the same as that of the user security profile you are
                creating.
      </p> 
            
      <p>If you specify the ID of a default profile in the Add User window, the
                items from the default profile will be copied into the user profile - except
                the user ID, user name and the owners.
      </p> 
            
      <p>On the Add User screen, you can then overwrite the items copied into
                the user profile and specify further items.
      </p> 
            
      <p>For further information, see

      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong><br> To define numerous users with identical security profiles, you can

               of user IDs. For each user, the user ID, user name and user type are
               displayed.
      </p> 
           
      <p>To add a user to the group, add the user ID to the list. To delete a
               user from the group, delete the user ID from the list.
      </p> 
           
      <p>Remember that users have to be defined to Natural Security before they
               can be added to a group.
      </p> 
           
      <p>It does not matter in which order you add new user IDs: when you
               catalog the list of group members (see command "CAT" below), they
               will automatically be sorted alphabetically.
      </p> 
           
      <p>To edit the list, you can use the Natural program editor scrolling
               commands, line commands and editor commands (as described in the Natural
               <cite>Editors</cite> documentation).
      </p> 
           
      <p>To add <em>all</em> users contained in one group to the group you are
               editing, enter the command <code>INCLUDE
            <var>group-ID</var></code> in the command line of the
               Edit Group Members screen. All users contained in the group whose ID you
               specify with the INCLUDE command will then be added to the list. They will be
               included before the user who is displayed in the top line of the screen.
      </p> 
           
      <p>Remember that a user of type "group" must not be contained
               within another group.
      </p> 
           
      <p>Modifications are only processed in the source area until you enter the
               command "CAT" in the command line (or press <span class="key">PF3</span>). This
               command first invokes a procedure which checks for duplicate IDs. If the IDs
               are unique, the edited list of members will be entered in the group's security
               profile.
      </p> 
           
      <p>With the command "CHECK" you invoke the checking procedure
               only.
      </p> 
           
      <p>To leave the Edit Group Members screen, enter a period (.) in the
               command line.
      </p>

      <h3> Copying a User's Links</h3> 
           
           
      <p>The Copy User's Links function is used to copy links from one existing
               user profile to another one of the same user type.
      </p> 
           
      <p>You can individually select the links to be copied. In addition to
               links, you can copy group memberships (including "Privileged
               Groups" specifications) and functional security definitions.
      </p> 
           
      <p>On the User Maintenance selection list, you mark the user whose links
               you wish to copy with function code "CP". A window will be
               displayed in which you enter the ID of the user to which you wish to copy
               links. In addition, you can restrict the selection of link types in the
               window:
      </p> 
           
      <ul> 
               
         <li> 
                   
            <p class="initem">Library links</p> 
                  
         </li> 
               
         <li> 
                   
            <p class="initem">Groups/Members</p> 
                  
         </li>

            <p class="initem">Utility links</p> 
                  
         </li>

            <p class="initem">Functional security</p> 
                  
         </li> 
               
         <li> 
                   
            <p class="initem">File links (if the user has a private library)</p> 
                  
         </li> 
               
         <li> 
                   
            <p class="initem">Environment links</p> 
                  
         </li> 
               
         <li> 
                   
            <p class="initem">External object links</p> 
                  
         </li> 
              
      </ul> 
           
      <p>By default, all the above are selected. To deselect one type, you
               remove the "X".
      </p> 
           
      <p>A list of all the first user's existing links (of the selected types)
               will then be displayed.
      </p> 
           
      <p>The listed links are not automatically preselected for copying. In the
               "Co" column of the list, you have to mark with function code
               "CO" each link you wish to be copied from the one user to the
               other.
      </p> 
           
      <p>You can mark one or more links per screen. For each link marked, a
               message indicating if it has been copied will be displayed. If a link cannot be
               copied, this will also be indicated. For example, if the user already has a
               link to a specific object, this cannot be replaced by a link copied from the
               other user.
