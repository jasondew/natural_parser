                bytes of additional data of your choice.
      </p> 
            
      <p>These additional data can be stored/read by means of a user exit
                subprogram which must contain a <code>CALLNAT</code> statement (with five
                parameters as described below) which in turn invokes one of the following
                subprograms:

      <p>In the User Exit field of the library profile or special link profile,
                you enter the name of the user exit that invokes one of the above
                subprograms.
      </p> 
            
      <p>To invoke the user exit, you mark "User Exit" with

                below).
      </p> 
            
      <p>If you wish to handle the additional data from within a library, you
                can also invoke the above subprograms by means of a user exit from a library
                itself. In this case you must copy the subprograms into that library (by using
                the SYSMAIN utility). When invoked from a library, each subprogram will check
                and ensure that only data concerning that library or the specified link are
                read/stored.

      <p>In the security profiles of the Natural system libraries, that is, all
                libraries whose IDs begin with "SYS" (except the library SYSTEM),
                you cannot specify a user exit.

      <p> * When you invoke SNAUREXT from outside SYSSEC, you may read several
                special links to the library by using the 2nd parameter as start value and
                specifying one of the following operators in the 5th parameter (A2):
                "EQ", "=", "GT", "&gt;",
                "LT", "&lt;", "GE",
                "&gt;=", "LE", "&lt;=". These operators
                determine the read condition as compared against the 2nd parameter. Return code
                (B2) "0" indicates that the specified special link has been found;
                any other value indicates that no such link has been found.
      </p> 
            
      <p>When you invoke SNAUREXT or SNAUSEXT from a special link profile in
                SYSSEC, the data will refer to the link you are currently maintaining. When you
                invoke SNAUREXT or SNAUSEXT from outside SYSSEC, the data will refer to the
                link between the specified user ID and the library from which you invoke the

                  <p>The table of steplibs as outlined above is fixed and cannot be
                                changed by the application itself; this means that the same steplib table
                                applies to all users who use the library.
                  </p> 
                            
                  <p>Via the Natural application programming interface (API) USR4025
                                (contained in the library SYSEXT), however, it is possible to dynamically
                                change individual entries in the steplib table. To make use of this
                                possibility, you have to adjust the steplib table as follows: Instead of an
                                actual steplib ID, you specify "********" (8
                                asterisks) in a field of the steplib window. At runtime, the actual steplib ID
                                for this position is then supplied by the application via the API.
                  </p> 
                            
                  <p>You can specify "********" in one or
                                more fields of the steplib table. The API only overwrites those fields in the
                                steplib table which contain "********"; any fields containing
                                actual steplib IDs (or blanks) are not affected by the API.
                  </p> 
                            
                  <p>Dynamic steplib assignment is only possible for the steplibs which
                                are last in the sequence of steplibs. This means that in the steplib table,
                                after any field(s) containing "********", there must be no field
                                containing an actual steplib ID.
                  </p> 
                            
                  <p>Thus it is possible, for example, to have a setup where the 1st to
                                4th steplibs are fixed as specified in the library profile, and the 5th and 6th
                                steplibs are supplied dynamically by the API.

                                window. If you assign "99999" as DBID value for a

                                password and cipher code values. If you assign no DBID value (or
                                "0") for a steplib in the steplib window of a
                                library profile, the DBID value of that library will be used. The same applies

      <p>If you mark "Editing Restrictions" in the Restrictions
                selection window with any character, the Editing Restrictions window will be
                displayed. In this window, you may allow or disallow the editing of Natural
                objects of certain object types.
      </p> 
            
      <p>By default, all object types shown in the Editing Restrictions window
                are marked with "Y", which means that objects of all types may be
                edited.

      <p>To disallow editing altogether, you may disallow the use of the EDIT
                command (see <a href="nsc_lib.htm#Command_Restrictions">Command
                   Restrictions</a> above). When you disallow the EDIT command, all object
                types in the Editing Restrictions window are automatically marked with
                "N". When you allow the EDIT command again, all object types in
                the Editing Restrictions window are automatically marked with "Y"
                again.

                selection window with any character, the Statement Restrictions screen will be
                displayed. On this and the next screen, you may allow or disallow the use of
                individual Natural statements. To get from this screen to the next and back
                again, you press <span class="key">PF7</span> and <span class="key">PF8</span> respectively.

      <p>By default, all statements shown on the Statement Restrictions screen
                are marked with "Y", which means that all statements are
                allowed.

      <h3>Listing Undefined Libraries</h3> 
           
           
      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong><br>In a non-mainframe environment, the use of the SHOW command requires
               that work file 3 has been defined in your Natural parameter module, because
               internally the command uses the corresponding function of the Natural Object
               Handler utility.
      </p> 
           
      <p>An undefined library is a library which exists on the system file, but
               for which no library security profile has been created in Natural Security.
      </p>
           
           
      <p>To ascertain which libraries are undefined, you can use the SHOW
               command. This will cause the to expand the Library Maintenance selection list
               to be expanded so that it also includes undefined libraries.
      </p> 
           
      <p>The syntax for the SHOW command is as follows:</p> 
           
      <p><code>SHOW ALL
            [FILE=(<var>database-id,file-number,password,ciphercode</var>)]</code></p>
           
           
      <p>or</p> 
           
      <p><code>SHOW +
            [FILE=(<var>database-id,file-number,password,ciphercode</var>)]</code></p>
           
           
      <p>With <code>FILE</code> you specify the system file whose
               undefined libraries are to be listed. If you omit the
               <code>FILE</code> specification, the undefined libraries on the
               current FUSER file will be listed. 
      </p> 
           
      <p>The system file to which the expanded list of libraries refers is shown
               at the top of the Library Maintenance selection list. The Message column of the
               selection list indicates which of the listed libraries are undefined.
      </p> 
           
      <p>Instead of entering the <code>SHOW ALL</code> command
               (without <code>FILE</code> specification) in the command line of
               the Library Maintenance selection list, you can also press <span class="key">PF16</span>.
      </p>
           
           
      <p>If you want to list only the undefined libraries, you either enter the
               command <code>SHOW UNDF</code> (with or without
               <code>FILE</code> specification) in the command line, or enter
               "UNDF" in the protection status field (Prot.).
      </p> 
           
      <p>To revert the Library Maintenance selection list to the standard
               display of only defined libraries, you press <span class="key">PF16</span> again or enter the
               following command in the command line:
      </p> 
           
      <p> <code>SHOW -</code></p> 
           
      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong><br>To list undefined libraries, you can also use the application
               programming interface <a href="nsc_iface.htm#Subprogram_NSCXR">NSCXR</a>
               (with object-type code "SF" (system file)).

      <p>When you delete a library profile, this option allows you to also
                delete the actual library itself. This means that the library - and all Natural

               security profile.
      </p> 
           
      <p>On the Library Maintenance selection list, you mark the library whose

      <h4>Defining a Private Library</h4> 
            
            
      <p>To define a private library to Natural Security, first mark the
                "Private Library" field in the user's security profile with "Y"
                (on the Add User, Copy User or Modify User screen) (marking this field does not
                cause any default private library profile to be created).
      </p> 
            
      <p>In the Additional Options window, you then select "Private
                Library"; or you press <span class="key">PF5</span> on the main user profile
                screen.
      </p> 
            
      <p>A Private Library screen will be displayed; the screen is identical to
                a "normal" library security profile screen (except when private
                libraries are used in private mode, in which case the screen does not contain
                the fields "People-protected" and
                "Terminal-protected"). On this screen and the subsequent
                screens/windows you define the security profile for the private library.
      </p> 
            
      <p>The library ID by which a private library is defined to Natural
                Security is identical to the respective user ID.
      </p>

      <h4>Maintaining a Private Library</h4> 
            
            
      <p>In private mode, maintenance of existing private library profiles is
                performed via <a href="nsc_user.htm#nsc_user">User Maintenance</a>.
      </p> 
            
      <p>In public mode, private libraries also appear on the Library
                Maintenance selection list along with the other libraries, that is, they can be
                maintained like "normal" libraries with the library maintenance
                functions described above.

      <h4>Deleting a Private Library</h4> 
            
            
      <p>If private libraries are used in public mode, you delete a private
                library like any other library (see <a href="nsc_lib.htm#Deleting_a_Library">Deleting a Library</a> above).
      </p> 
            
      <p>If private libraries are used in private mode, you delete a private
                library by marking the "Private Library" field in the user's security profile
                with "N". A window will be invoked in which you confirm the
                deletion by typing in the library ID.
      </p> 
            
      <p>Depending on the setting of the general option

                   Non-empty Libraries Allowed"</a> (described in the section
