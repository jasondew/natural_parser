                     addition: Although the library is not protected, it is possible to link a group
                     to the library. Only one group can be linked to the library, and the link must
                     be a special link. This special link only applies to users of type
                     "A" contained in the group. This feature is only intended to allow
                     administrators different access to an unprotected library for maintenance
                     purposes. (The special link to such a library can only be established via the
                     function "Link users to library" which is invoked from the Library
                     Maintenance selection list.)

      <p>In public mode, other users' access to someone's private library is
               determined by the settings of the fields "People-protected" and
               "Terminal-protected" in the security profile of the private
               library. Possible values for the field "People-protected" are
               "P" (which is the default value, and which corresponds to
               "Y" in other library profiles) and "N" (which is the
               same as in other library profiles). Possible values for the field
               "Terminal-protected" are the same as for other libraries (Y, N or

      <p>If you press <span class="key">PF5</span>, the NSC Utility Access Rights window will
                be displayed, providing an overview of the utility functions which you are
                allowed to use in each library.

                        window lists the functions available in that utility.

            <p class="initem">If you have issued the PROFILE command elsewhere, the window lists
                        all utilities along with information on whether some or all functions of a
                        utility are allowed/disallowed for a specific library. (The notation
                        &lt;others&gt; in the Library field of the window indicates all libraries for
                        which nothing specific has been defined.) To obtain more detailed information
                        on the utility functions allowed for a particular library, you can select one
                        or more libraries from the window by marking them with any character.
