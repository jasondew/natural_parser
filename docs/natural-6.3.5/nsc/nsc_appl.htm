      <p>This section describes how to protect the Natural Development Server
              environment with Natural Security, and how the security definitions on the FSEC
              system file attached to the server environment affect actions on the server. It

      <h3> Client and Server Actions</h3> 
           
           
      <p>Generally, you have to distinguish between:</p> 
           
      <ul> 
               
         <li> 
                   
            <p class="initem">Natural actions which are processed in the server environment,</p> 
                  
         </li> 
               
         <li> 
                   
            <p class="initem">Natural actions which are only processed in the client
                       environment.
            </p> 
                  
         </li> 
              
      </ul> 
           
      <p>When a Natural Development Server runs under control of Natural
               Security, only actions on the server can be protected by Natural Security. The
               conditions of use established by Natural Security which apply to a user's
               session on the <em>server</em> are <em>not</em> transferred to a
               <var>client</var> session.
      </p> 
           
      <p>Also, remember that some actions performed on a Natural Development
               Server client (mapped environment) generate a call to the Natural Development
               Server server, while others do not. Only if a client action causes an action on
               the Natural Development Server, this resulting server action will come under
               the control of Natural Security.
      </p> 
           
          
         
      <div><a name="MapEnvironment"></a></div> 
          
      <h3> Map Environment and Library Selection</h3> 
           
           
      <p>The function "Map Environment" is controlled by the
               Natural Security settings that apply to the FNAT system file on which this
               function is executed. When the function is executed, Natural Security performs
               a logon, according to the rules as described in the section
               <a href="nsc_logon.htm#Logon_Procedure">Logon
            Procedure</a>. The logon will be to the user's default
               library, therefore the security settings have to be such that the user is able
               to log on to his/her default library.
      </p> 
           
      <p>Once the environment has been mapped, the tree view in the mapped
               environment lists all non-empty libraries on the system file (FUSER/FNAT)
               assigned to the mapped environment which are accessible by the user.
      </p> 
           
      <p>When the user selects one of these libraries from the tree view, a
               logon to this library is performed - according to the rules as described in the
               section <a href="nsc_logon.htm#Logon_Procedure">Logon
            Procedure</a>. Thus it may be possible, for example, that a
               startup transaction is executed. The user can only select a library from the
               tree view; any other library selection (for example, via the system command
               "LOGON *") is not possible.
      </p> 
           
      <p>Within a library in the mapped environment, some functions can be
               protected by Natural Security, others cannot be protected. Which functions
               these are is described below.
      </p>

      <h3> Protectable Functions in the Mapped Environment</h3> 
           
           
      <p>The use of the following functions in a library within the mapped
               environment can be protected as follows:

                REGISTER, RETURN, RUN, SAVE, SCAN, SETUP, STOW, TEST, UNREGISTER, UPDATE,

      <p>If DDMs are stored on a system file specified with the Natural profile

                command EDIT DDM is also available from within a user-created library. This
                means that it is not necessary to expand the DDM node in the tree view to be
                able to edit a specific DDM. However, the use of the commands LIST DDM and EDIT
                DDM in a server environment can only be restricted via the security profile of
                the Natural <a href="nsc_util.htm#Default_Profile_for_SYSDDM_Utility">SYSDDM

      <p>Applications are <em>base applications</em> and <em>compound
            applications</em> which are created and maintained in the Natural Studio's
                application workspace and used in conjunction with the Natural Development
                Server.
      </p> 
            
      <p>For information on base and compound applications, please refer to the
                <cite>Natural Development Server</cite> documentation.
      </p> 
            
      <p>Unless otherwise indicated, the term "application" within
                the Natural Security documentation comprises both base applications and
                compound applications.

      <h4> General Concept</h4> 
            
            
      <p>The protection of applications is only relevant in conjunction with
                the Natural Development Server. If you do not use the Natural Development
                Server, you need not concern yourself with application protection in Natural
                Security.
      </p> 
            
      <p>If you use the Natural Development Server, you should use Natural
                Security to control the access to applications on the development server
                file.
      </p> 
            
      <p>By protecting an application, you control users' access to it; that
                is, you control whether users are allowed to read, add, modify or delete the
                application in the Natural Studio's application workspace. These access rights
                are defined in an application security profile.
      </p> 
            
      <p>Application protection in Natural Security only affects access to an
                application as such; it has no effect on access to the Natural programming
                objects contained in the libraries that may be part of the application.

      <h4> Naming Conventions</h4> 
            
            
      <p>Application IDs in Natural Security must conform to the application
                naming conventions which are defined in the Natural Development Server. Natural
                Security will check if they do.
      </p> 
            
           
          
      <div><a name="HierarchiesOfApplProf"></a></div> 
           
      <h4> Hierarchies of Application Profiles</h4> 
            
            
      <p>The installation procedures of both Natural Security and the Natural
                Development Server automatically create two application security profiles with
                the application IDs "* Base Application *" and "* Compound
                Application *". These are the basic security profiles which apply to all
                base applications and compound applications respectively for which no
                individual security profiles are defined. The default access settings in the
                two basic profiles are all preset to "N"; you can change them to
                suit your requirements.
      </p> 
            
      <p>The Natural Development Server naming conventions allow you to set up
                a hierarchy of application profiles: If you create an application security
                profile for an application whose ID is a certain character string, the profile
                will apply to all applications whose IDs begin with that character string.
                Thus, you need not define a profile for every single application.
      </p> 
            
      <p>For example, if you defined a base application security profile with
                the ID "A", it would apply to all base applications whose IDs
                begin with "A" (such a "APPLX", "AA01",
                "ABC", "ADE" etc.). A profile with the ID
                "ABC" would in turn apply to, for example, "ABCA",
                "ABCXYZ" etc.
      </p> 
            
      <h4 class="floating-title">Asterisk as Default Access</h4> 
            
      <p>Such a profile hierarchy can be employed to allow/disallow at
                different levels the individual <a href="nsc_appl.htm#Default_Access_nsc_appl">default access</a> methods (see
                below) to be defined within the application profiles. If a default access in an
                application profile is set to "*", the setting in the profile at
                the next higher level applies for this access method.
      </p> 
            
      <p>For example, let us assume the following base application profiles
                with the following settings:

      <p>The hierarchy described above corresponds to the hierarchy you can set
                up for Predict documentation objects. In fact, base and compound applications
                correspond to Predict documentation objects of type "system",
                subtypes "-B" and "-O" respectively (as described in
                the Predict documentation).
      </p> 
            
      <p>Base and compound applications also appear as Predict documentation
                objects types "SY-B" and "SY-O" in Natural Security's
                subsystem for <a href="nsc_extobj.htm#nsc_extobj">external objects</a>. It
                is therefore possible to maintain application profiles either in the external
                objects maintenance subsystem or in the application maintenance subsystem.
                However, it is strongly recommended that you only use the application subsystem
                - but not the external objects subsystem - to maintain application
                profiles.
