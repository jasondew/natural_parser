      <p>The Administrator Services subsystem provides several functions which
             apply to Natural Security as a whole and to all security profiles.
      </p> 
         
      <p>You select "Administrator Services" on the Main Menu. If you

             displayed.
      </p> 
         
      <p>The Administrator Services Menu consists of two screens. With
             <span class="key">PF7</span> and <span class="key">PF8</span>, you can switch between the two screens. They
             provide the following functions:

                     With "X", however, these error counters are kept for logon
                     procedures in subsequent sessions, thus reducing the number of subsequent logon
                     attempts with these user IDs. This means that the chances of someone gaining
                     access with another user's ID are reduced considerably. With "X",
                     the error counter for a user ID is only reset after a successful logon.

               contains detailed information on each of the <var>n</var> logon
               attempts that led to the record being written (for example, which user and
               library IDs were entered by the user). The records may be viewed by using the

      <p>With the above Delete functions, you can delete logon records page by

              services settings. "Modify" in this context comprises all maintenance functions
              applied to a security profile (including Add, Copy, Delete, Link, etc.); it

      <h2> SAF Online Services</h2> 
          
          
      <p>SAF Online Services provide several functions for monitoring the SAF
              server.
      </p> 
          
      <p>SAF Online Services are only available on mainframe computers; they are
              only available if Natural SAF Security (or any other SAF-related Software AG
              product) is installed.
      </p> 
          
      <p>Before you can use SAF Online Services, you have to define a utility
              security profile for the utility SYSSAFOS (which contains the SAF Online
              Services).
      </p> 
          
      <p>To invoke SAF Online Services, you select "Administrator
              Services" on the Main Menu. The Administrator Services Menu will be
              displayed.

      <p>On the Administrator Services Menu, you select "SAF online
              services". The Online Services menu will be displayed, which provides
              the following functions:

      <h2> User Default Profiles</h2> 
          
          
      <p>Before you use default profiles, you should be familiar with the
              "normal" way of defining users as explained in the section
              <a href="nsc_user.htm#nsc_user">User
            Maintenance</a>.
      </p> 
          
      <p>When you add new users, you can either type in every item of every user
              security profile by hand, or you can use a pre-defined user default profile as
              a template for the creation of a user security profile. When you have to define
              numerous users whose security profiles are to be very similar to one another,
              you can define in a default profile the items which are to be the same for many
              users, and then use this default profile as the basis for the individual
              security profiles. By using default profiles, you can thus reduce the amount of
              work required to define users to Natural Security.
      </p> 
          
      <p>You create a default profile as described below, and then use it as a
              template for a user security profile as described in the section
              <a href="nsc_user.htm#nsc_user">User
            Maintenance</a>.

      <p>When you add a new user, you can specify the ID of a default profile
               which is to be used as a template for the user security profile you are
               creating.
      </p> 
           
      <p>The <var>user type</var> of the default profile must be
               the same as that of the security profile you use it for.
      </p> 
           
      <p>When you use a default profile to add a new user, the items from the
               default profile are copied into the user profile - except the user ID, user
               name and the owners.
      </p> 
           
      <p>In the user profile, you can overwrite the items copied from the
               default profile, and specify further items.

      <h2> Library Default Profiles</h2> 
          
          
      <p>Before you use default library security profiles, you should be familiar
              with the "normal" way of defining libraries as explained in the
              section <a href="nsc_lib.htm#nsc_lib">Library
            Maintenance</a>.
      </p> 
          
      <p>When you add new libraries, you can either type in every item of every
              library security profile by hand, or you can use a pre-defined default library
              profile as a template for the creation of a library security profile. When you
              have to define numerous libraries whose security profiles are to be very
              similar to one another, you can define in a default profile the items which are
              to be the same for many libraries, and then use this default profile as the
              basis for the individual security profiles. By using default library profiles,
              you can thus reduce the amount of work required to define libraries to Natural
              Security.
      </p> 
          
      <p>You create a default profile as described below, and then use it as a
              template for a library security profile as described in the section
              <a href="nsc_lib.htm#nsc_lib">Library
            Maintenance</a>.
